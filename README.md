Project 4: Ashby, Joy, Shawn, and Paul

## Project 4

You will work with your group to solve, analyze, or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies we’ve learned. Here are the specific requirements:

## Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
You must use at least two of the following:
Python Pandas
Python Matplotlib
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
JavaScript Plotly
JavaScript Leaflet
SQL Database
MongoDB Database
Google Cloud SQL
Amazon AWS
Tableau


## Considerations
Remember to closely monitor any AWS resources that you choose to use. It’s crucial that you clean up and stop, or shut down any AWS resources to avoid accruing additional costs.

## Working with Your Group
When working on an online group project, it’s crucial to meet with your group and communicate regularly. Plan for significant collaboration time outside of class. The following tips can help you make the most of your time:

Decide how you’re going to communicate with your group members when you begin. Create a Slack channel, exchange phone numbers, and ensure that the group knows each group member’s available working hours.

Set up an agile project by using GitHub ProjectsLinks to an external site. so that your group can track tasks.

Create internal milestones to ensure that your group is on track. Set due dates for these milestones so that you have a timeline for completing the project. Some of these milestones might include:

Project ideation

Data fetching/API integration

Data analysis

Building the ML model

Testing

Creating documentation

Creating the presentation

Since this is a two-week project, make sure that you have done at least half of your project by the end of the first week to stay on track.

Although you will divide the work among the group members, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your teammates regularly and offer support.

## Support and Resources
Your instructional team will provide support during classes and office hours. You will also have access to learning assistants and tutors to help you with topics as needed. Make sure to take advantage of these resources as you collaborate with your group on this first project.

## Project Guidelines
The following project guidelines focus on teamwork, your project proposal, data sources, and data cleanup and analysis.

## Collaborating with Your Team
Remember that these projects are a group effort. The experience of close collaboration will create better project outcomes and help you in your future careers. Specifically, you’ll learn collaborative workflows that will enable you to approach and solve complex problems. Working in groups allows you to work smart and dream big. Take advantage!

## Project Proposal
Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This will help provide direction and safeguard against scope creep (the tendency for projects to become more complex after work begins).

The proposal is essentially a brief summary of your interests and intent. Be sure to include the following details:

The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (finance, healthcare surveys, etc.)

The questions you’ll ask of the data

Possible source for the data

Use the following example for guidance:

The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in credit card fraud. We’ll examine relationships between transaction types and location, purchase prices and times of day, purchase trends over the course of a year, and other related relationships derived from the data.
